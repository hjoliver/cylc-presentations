								Cylc allows you to construct and run distributed <b>application

								<p>The arrows (or graph edges) represent dependencies.
								For maximum flexibility, Cylc works with abstract dependencies,

								<p>Here's a glimpse of the DSL we use for defining these

										<p>So, Cylc started as a small research project on how to

										The red tasks here are large atmospheric model runs,

										<p>
										This pretty much maxed out our aging HPC at the time and it

								<p>THIS is scaling! A handlful of those dots are your puny

								<p>But seriously, workflow orchestration really is at the heart
								of good utilization of massive HPC resources, BECAUSE:</p>
								<ul>
										<li>You won't be running massive MPP models all of the
										time</li>
										
										<li>and processing the output of huge models typically
										involves staggering numbers of small jobs</li>

										<li>and it's hard to use that much machine effectively by
										submitting millions of jobs manually - you need some

										<li>and finally, MPP scaling is actually not all that

								 Here's a small workflow, the red task might be an
								 atmospheric model.
								 </p>
								 <p>
								 Let's say you want to run this periodically, say every six
								 hours to generate new forecasts.
								 <p>
								 <p>1 ... 2 ... 3 ... you run whole cycles in sequence like
								 this. That's fine because in real time operation there's
								 always a gap between cycles while you want on new data to come
								 in. </p>

								 <p>BUT what if you suffer a major delay and get behind the
								 clock, so that one cycle runs into the next?  Historically,
								 you still had to run whole cycles in sequence because (a)
								 people seemed to think these global cycles were a fundamental
								 feature of the system; and (b) your workflow engine didn't
								 know about inter-cycle dependence.</p>

								 <p>E.g. each model task depends on the previous model task,
								 because each forecast has to be partially initialized by the
								 previous forecast.</p>

								 <p>In fact those numbered "forecast cycle" boxes are clearly
								 an artificial constraint on the system - each individual task
								 in that workflow only cares about its own individual
								 dependence on other upstream tasks.</p>

								 <p>So, Cylc unwinds the cycle loop and gives each task its own
								 cycle point label, to create <b>a single potentially INFINITE
										workflow composed of repeating tasks</b> instead of a
								 sequence of distinct single cycle workflows. So that's an
								 interesting new form of scaling!</p>

							Memoization is: automatically caching a look-up table of function

								 <p>In Cylc, there's a lot of stuff we have to get done
								 concurrently, to avoid blocking the main scheduling algorithm
								 for instance.  That includes all interaction with the external
								 world: job submissions, event handlers, external triggers.
								 </p>

								 <p>Consider a function called task-1 that takes this long to
								 run.<p>

								 <p>And it happens to do a bunch of IO in the middle: compute
								 is colored, IO is gray</p>

								 <p>Now compute happens to go a gazillion times faster than IO:
								 disk or network, so your CPU is more or less idle forever
								 during IO operations.</p>

								 <p>Typical synchronous program: read and process 3 files in
								 sequence.</p>

								 <p>What are our options for speeding this up?</p>
								 <ul>
										<li>Multiprocessing: truly parallel processing, and it even
										works for CPU-bound programs, but it uses more resources,
										and it only scales to the number of processors. Used a lot
										in Cylc</li>
										<li> (Threading will also help alot for IO-bound programs,
										but that's harder to represent in a
										diagram like this, and harder to explain, especially in
										Python, so I won't go there today).
										</li>
								 </ul>

										<!--
								 (the OS switches randomnly between threads and in Python, the
								 GIL won't let the coloured bits execute in parallel, but they
								 can execute in parallel with the gray IO)-->

							   <p>Now there's a new kid on the block, in terms of nice
										built-in Python-3 language support at least: asynchronous
										"cooperative multi-tasking"</p>

									<p>It works like this: instead of executing your tasks
									directly and deterministically as per synchronous paradigm,
									you cede control to something called an event loop which 
									can start executing other tasks during asynchronous IO operations.
									Remarkably, because of the extreme discrepancy between IO and
									compute time, for IO-bound programs this can often scale to
									thousands of tasks in a single thread, without the complexity
									and danger of thread management.</p>

                 <!--
								 asyncio: tornado, wf scan, and more...

								  - CPU Bound => Multi Processing
									-	I/O Bound, Fast I/O, Limited Number of Connections => Multi Threading
									-	I/O Bound, Slow I/O, Many connections => Asyncio
									-->

									<!--
									GIL - only one thread at a time can manipulate Python objects

									CPython implementation detail: In CPython, due to the Global
									Interpreter Lock, only one thread can execute Python code at
									once (even though certain performance-oriented libraries
									might overcome this limitation). If you want your application
									to make better use of the computational resources of
									multi-core machines, you are advised to use multiprocessing
									or concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor. However, threading
									is still an appropriate model if you want to run multiple
									I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.

									https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock

									    The mechanism used by the CPython interpreter to assure
									that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This
									simplifies the CPython implementation by making the object
									model (including critical built-in types such as dict)
									implicitly safe against concurrent access. Locking the entire
									interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be
									multi-threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism
									afforded by multi-processor machines.

									    However, some extension modules, either standard or
									third-party, are designed so as to release the GIL when doing
									computationally-intensive tasks such as compression or
									hashing. Also, the GIL is always released when doing I/O.

									    Past efforts to create a “free-threaded” interpreter (one
									which locks shared data at a much finer granularity) have not
									been successful because performance suffered in the common
									single-processor case. It is believed that overcoming this
									performance issue would make the implementation much more
									complicated and therefore costlier to maintain.
									-->

									<!--
									The battle over async IO versus multiprocessing is not really
									a battle at all. In fact, they can be used in concert. If you
									have multiple, fairly uniform CPU-bound tasks (a great
									example is a grid search in libraries such as scikit-learn or
									keras), multiprocessing should be an obvious choice.

									The contest between async IO and threading is a little bit
									more direct. I mentioned in the introduction that “threading
									is hard.” The full story is that, even in cases where
									threading seems easy to implement, it can still lead to
									infamous impossible-to-trace bugs due to race conditions and
									memory usage, among other things.

									Threading also tends to scale less elegantly than async IO,
									because threads are a system resource with a finite
									availability. Creating thousands of threads will fail on many
									machines, and I don’t recommend trying it in the first place.
									Creating thousands of async IO tasks is completely feasible.

									Async IO shines when you have multiple IO-bound tasks where
									the tasks would otherwise be dominated by blocking IO-bound
									wait time, such as:

						 tasks that are spawned ahead before they are needed; and gray
						 finished tasks that are kept around until no longer need for
						 matching the depedencies of waiting tasks. This works well BUT it

									to support our existing sites and users, but I can imagine
									it might be useful to get wider uptake.</p>
									<p>IMO the barriers here are at least partly of perception and
									superficial trend-following, but that's life innit - so what
									can we do about it?
									</p>

									<p>OTHER BARRIERS... (historical) frustratingly, much of
									this is trivial - trust me, it is easier to bolt "cloud
									support" (e.g.) on to Cylc than to make other systems do
									cycling properly. But the reality is, that's how people see
									it, so we have to take that seriously.</p>

									<p>One thing we're trying to do with Cylc 8 is make the
									generality of Cylc more obvious, for instance by getting
									rid of domain-specific terminology such as "suite" for
									"workflow".</p>
