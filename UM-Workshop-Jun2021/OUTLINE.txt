RECAP
 - Python 2, GUI
 - Web UI
    => new architecture
 - increasing demands
    => efficiency

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE THE NOV WORKSHOP
 - deja vu?
 - many of the features shown in Nov that were flagged as planned or in-progress are now complete

8.0.0 RELEASE?
 - show Nov 2020 slide (b0 Jan 2021 at best) - not too far behind
 - we're currently on 2nd beta release, very much usable
 - for the last year, aiming for 30 June 8.0
 - somewhat arbitrary when we make the cut-off, BUT:
   - still a few things we haven't quite finished off
   - current aim: September for deployment as default version at Met Office (and Feb for operations)
   - 8.0 sometime before that

WHAT'S NEW
 - architecture: client/server => hub, UIS, UI, scheduler
 - UI:
   - CLI (TUI)
   - web UI
   - task-job separation
 - efficiency:
   - incremental push data updates from scheduler => UI server => UI
   - shared data store in the UI
   - spawn-on-demand scheduler
   - UI n-window
 - security
   - authentication
   - authorization
 - rose suite-run migration
   - cylc install
   - run1/2/.../N
   - play, pause, stop

UI examples (updated)

Scheduler Efficiency and SoD Examples
 - reflow, and start-from-task!
   - better warm start, replace checkpoint restart
 - SoD mitigates the cost of parameterized cycling
 - suicide triggers etc.
